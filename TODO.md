# TODOs for MCP Server Hand-off

## Setup Completed âœ…
- Google Cloud Logging SDK installed
- Authentication implemented using Application Default Credentials
- API client with proper error handling
- Domain logic for queryLogs and getLogDetail
- ~~Configuration support (environment variables and code-based)~~ Environment variables removed - only uses ADC
- In-memory caching with TTL and size limits
- Type-safe implementation ~~with branded types~~ using interface pattern for LogId
- All tests passing (71 tests, including unit tests for pure functions)
- Comprehensive README documentation
- `.mcp.json` created with your project ID (dinii-self-develop)
- ESLint configured with TypeScript support and arrow-body-style rule
- Pure functions extracted for better testability
- listProjects tool implemented

## Remaining Tasks

### ðŸ”´ TOP PRIORITY: Project ID Management
- [ ] **Make projectId required** - Remove optional project ID and require explicit project ID in all tool calls
  - Update input schemas to make projectId required
  - Remove default project detection logic
  - Update error messages to indicate projectId is required
- [x] **Add `listProjects` tool** - Allow users to discover available Google Cloud projects
  - Use Google Resource Manager API to list projects
  - Show project ID, name, and status
  - ~~Cache the project list for the session~~ (not implemented)
- [ ] **Update tool descriptions** - Make it clear that projectId is required

Implementation approach:
1. ~~Add `@google-cloud/resource-manager` dependency~~ (already added)
2. ~~Create new tool `listProjects` in the MCP server~~ (already implemented)
3. Modify queryLogs and getLogDetail to require projectId
4. Update input schemas to make projectId required

### 1. High Priority TODOs (From Dropped Commits)
- [ ] **Implement retry logic with exponential backoff** - Add automatic retry for transient Google Cloud API failures
- [x] **Fix object serialization in summaries** - Objects currently show as "[Object object]" in log summaries
- [x] **Add time range arguments to queryLogs** - Support startTime/endTime parameters with ISO 8601 format
- [ ] **Document SEARCH function and query syntax** - Add comprehensive documentation for Google Cloud Logging query syntax
- [ ] **Fix all linting errors** - Resolve TypeScript strict mode violations (no any, no type assertions, etc.)

### 2. Test the MCP Server
- [ ] Run `bun run src/main.ts` to verify the server starts correctly
- [ ] Test with Claude Code to ensure the tools are available
- [ ] Verify you can query logs from your Google Cloud project

### 3. Configure ESLint (Optional)
- [x] ~~The ESLint configuration is missing - add `.eslintrc.js` or `eslint.config.js`~~ (`.eslintrc.json` exists)
- [x] ~~Current lint script in package.json won't work without proper config~~ (ESLint is properly configured)

### 4. Code-Level TODOs
- [ ] **Extract shared Tool type** - The `Tool<InputSchema>` type is duplicated in queryLogs.ts and getLogDetail.ts
- [ ] **Add redaction tests** - Add tests for sensitive information redaction in log summaries (marked as TODO in log-entry.test.ts)

### 5. Implement Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Add support for resource name filtering
- [ ] Implement log streaming/tailing functionality
- [ ] Add more sophisticated query builders
- [ ] Support for structured logging queries
- [ ] Add metrics/telemetry for monitoring MCP server usage

### 6. Production Considerations
- [ ] Add proper logging for the MCP server itself
- [ ] ~~Implement retry logic with exponential backoff~~ (moved to high priority)
- [ ] Add connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Consider adding request/response validation middleware
- [ ] Add health check endpoint

### 7. Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add integration tests with real Google Cloud Logging API
- [ ] Add tests for error scenarios (network failures, auth issues)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for cache effectiveness
- [ ] Test with large log volumes

### 8. Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] ~~Add example queries for common use cases~~ (moved to high priority)
- [ ] ~~Document the Google Cloud Logging query syntax~~ (moved to high priority)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting for common permission issues
- [ ] Create a video tutorial for setup

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Test the server locally
bun run src/main.ts

# Run tests
bun test

# Type check
bun run typecheck

# Format code
bun run format
```

## Notes
- Your Google Cloud account (yuto.ogino@dinii.jp) is already authenticated
- Project ID is set to: dinii-self-develop
- The server uses stdio transport for MCP communication
- Cache is configured for 30 minutes TTL and 1000 max entries by default
